# Hello-World
I suppose I've got to learn how to use this site somehow.

Now I can write other things in here.
so this site is also like a code editor?
It seems to have less features than any other editor I've used, at least so far, but maybe its better for collaboration?
We'll see I suppose.

Here comes the branch edits!! This seems like a fantastic way to keep different versions or create experimental ones, so awesome. 
This file should now be different from the original which I added to after I made it.
